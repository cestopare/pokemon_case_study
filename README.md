This exploratory data analysis of the usefulness of Fairy-type Pokémon aims to determine their effectiveness as a counter to Dragon-type Pokémon in battles through the examination of metrics such as type, total stats, HP, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed.

In the world of Pokémon, each type of Pokémon has a corresponding type that it is particularly vulnerable to. For example, fire-type Pokémon are vulnerable to water-type Pokémon, and ice-type Pokémon are weak against fire-types. Historically, dragon-type Pokémon were only vulnerable to themselves. With the introduction of fairy-type Pokémon, dragon-type Pokémon now have a new type that they are weak against.
In this study, I aimed to understand the strengths and weaknesses of fairy-type Pokémon in comparison to their natural rivals in the Pokémon universe using a Pokémon database. The study aimed to determine if the introduction of this new type was useful, assess its overall strength, and determine if it was truly necessary. The dragon-type Pokémon was previously only weak against itself, but with the inclusion of fairy-type Pokémon, dragon-types now have a rival type they are especially weak against.
